# Lab Power Supply

This repository contains the KiCAD files and documentation for a simple lab
power supply.

The KiCAD files are in the top level.

The exported gerber and NC drill files are in the `gerbers` directory.

The documentation for the project is in the `doc` directory. This includes:

- KiCAD and DigiKey bills of materials in `doc/bom`.
- Datasheets for all ICs used in `doc/datasheets`.
- PCB layer PDFs in `doc/pcb`.
- A schematic PDF at `doc/psu-schematic.pdf`.
- A comprehensive manual in `doc/manual`.

Note that some parts on hand were used and not included in the DigiKey BOM.
These discrepancies are documented in `doc/bom/non-digikey.txt`.

*The development of this power supply was generously funded by the Reed College
Physics Department during the summer of 2019.*
